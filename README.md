## Modules

The repository includes the following modules:

1. **data_types.py** - Basic data types and structures (integers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.)
2. **control_flow.py** - Control flow statements (if-else, loops, break/continue).
3. **functions.py** - Functions, lambda expressions, and higher-order functions.
4. **classes_oop.py** - Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, encapsulation).
5. **modules_and_packages.py** - Working with modules, packages, and imports.
6. **error_handling.py** - Exception handling using try-except, custom exceptions.
7. **file_handling.py** - File input/output operations, reading/writing files.
8. **standard_libraries.py** - Using common libraries like `math`, `random`, `os`, and `datetime`.
9. **data_science.py** - Basics of `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and analysis.
10. **decorators.py** - Function decorators and examples of use cases.
11. **concurrency.py** - Basics of multithreading and multiprocessing.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ranga04/python.git
cd python
```

For modules like `data_science.py` that require external libraries, install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run each module individually to explore its content and examples. For instance:

```bash
python data_types.py
```

Or, use the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Modules Description

Each module covers different aspects of Python programming:

- **data_types.py**: Covers Python's basic data types, type conversions, and data structures.
- **control_flow.py**: Demonstrates conditional statements, loops, and control flow.
- **functions.py**: Provides examples of function definitions, lambda functions, and decorators.
- **classes_oop.py**: Illustrates object-oriented programming principles in Python.
- **modules_and_packages.py**: Covers importing modules, working with packages, and standard libraries.
- **error_handling.py**: Shows how to handle exceptions gracefully in Python.
- **file_handling.py**: Introduces file reading and writing operations.
- **standard_libraries.py**: Demonstrates popular standard libraries for general-purpose use.
- **data_science.py**: Introduces `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
- **decorators.py**: Explains the use of decorators to extend function behavior.
- **concurrency.py**: Covers basics of threading and multiprocessing for concurrent execution.
